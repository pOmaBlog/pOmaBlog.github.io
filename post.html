                    <p>The two infamous heroines I am about to discuss here frankly need no introduction, but heck, I cannot resist.</p>

                    <blockquote><b>Eve</b><br><u>Occupation</u>: running around Eden with a guy named Adam. Fervent adept of nudism. <br><u>Main achievement</u>: ruining it for the human race for ever (or nearly, there is something about a son of God coming back to earth to save the party for the “worthy” ones). <br><u>Crime weapon</u>: succumbed to temptation.</blockquote>

                    <blockquote><b>Pandora</b><br><u>Occupation</u>: roaming the earth with titan partner, studying this weird primitive race called human. <br><u>Main achievement</u>: ruining it for the human race for ever (this time for sure). <br><u>Crime weapon</u>: succumbed to temptation.</blockquote>

					<p>Sounds pretty similar right? A tat overbearing maybe? It would probably be funny if myths or religious texts (call it what you may) such as these ones had not been used to restrict women liberties for millennia. After all, neither Eve nor Pandora  could be trusted, or restrained, right? From this statement to assuming that women are irrational and led only by feelings, there is only a step. A step that our societies had zero difficulty taking. This image of female as weaker intellectual beings, incapable of restraint, have hindered their access to “rational teaching” i.e., education and scientific research. </p>
					
					<p>“Things have change” I hear you say. And yes, I agree. They have. Although things are still far from perfect (see future posts tagged “#today’s challenges”). What I find deeply disturbing however is that, still today, these female portraits have infused our societies so deeply that we too often forget that they could/should be interpreted differently. I feel it is about time for a clean reset. Here comes my take on good old Eve and Pandora. Breaking news: the first ever researchers were women.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Eve in wonderland</h2>
					
					<p>Let’s start  with Eve and her life in Eden, designed by a certain all-powerful, omniscient […] God. All is perfect in Eden. A wonder of God’s creation. Imagine a very well-kept preservation park, where everything is done to keep the animals happy and pretty oblivious of their captive state. An improved version of the London zoo without the annoying children and the ice cream trucks. In this very well regimented and controlled environment, by God that is, there is this one tree with very attractive fruits and a horrible snake (a very troubling parallel with the jungle book if I may). God asks all its creatures to not eat this tree’s fruits. </p>

                    <p>Let’s take a step back here. Assuming God is not a complete sadist, there is one important question to ask: How come this damn tree came to be in Eden if there is no PURPOSE for it? It’s not like God is a gardening newbie that is experimenting growing tomatoes on its 2m2 balcony! After all he/she (who decided god is a male?) created life, the earth and all that surrounds it in only 6 days. (Although, retrospectively, it does sound a bit like a bad advert for the internet of things: “in only 1 day you will be able to control your house ecosystem, spy on your spouse, track your children, spam your coworker AND take the evening off to stream your life live on facebook”.) </p>
					
					<p>What other purpose for that tree to be in Eden then to allow one of its creatures to DISOBEY i.e., to make her own choice. In fact, even if God turns out to be a complete sadist (not quite so unlikely if you ask me, considering current and past state of affairs), she/he still involuntary gave this one opportunity for disobedience. By picking the fruit, Eve shows the capacity for novel and individual thinking guided by nothing but her free will. </p>
					
					<blockquote>Any reader who is a parent knows that stage in a child, when they become their own self. The amazement when you see your little one suddenly deciding to have their own adventures. The anguish when you realize these plans nearly always involve, for some obscure reasons, eating electric cables, licking your shoes and pulling on any hanging items. </blockquote>
					
					<p>Let’s go back to Eden, our sinner and her tree for a moment. “It is all about the snake!” I hear some of you say. Okey, let’s assume this biblical version of Kaa was there with its big psychedelic eyes and tempting voice. Well, even if that was the case, Eve still had the choice between what was ordered and what was offered to her. In that sense, she did make a conscious choice to try this fruit. </p>
					
					<p>So, what is there to conclude from this tale then? Well if we agree that fundamental scientific discoveries have often been made in opposition to existing dogmas, by researchers able to disobey the “it’s not possible/allowed” consensus, then Eve falls in this category, at very least in temperament. She may very well be the first experimentalist in the history of humankind. As for the pain, horrors […] that get unleashed as a result: well guess what, science is scary! But let’s switch to Pandora to discuss this aspect a bit more.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Pandora and the goblet of fire</h2>

                    <p>Good old Pandora is getting many gifts from the Gods, but one is particularly interesting: the gift of curiosity by Zeus. If you want to picture Zeus, imagine a grumpy old grandpa, sexist as we don’t make them anymore (hopefully), passed the expiring date. Zeus planted curiosity in Pandora as a revenge against (here comes one of this family tree Greek mythology cherishes) the brother of her lover. Curiosity, interesting right? Isn’t it precisely curiosity that drives any good scientist/researcher? Anyways, Zeus also provides a box (or a jar of some kind, translators still disagree) to Pandora, which, of course, she is not supposed to open. Let’s fast forward a bit here. </p>
					
					<p><b>Big spoiler: Pandora ends up opening the box</b> </p>
					
					<p>What happens next is what, I think, we should focus on: she frees all the demons of the earth. Death, diseases, storm… Does that not ring a bell? To all these demons there is an associated scientific field. Anachronical? Yes of course! But my point is the following: science is about tempering with the unknown, at least investigating it, and like Pandora opening her box, there is something terrifying about it. Often, it shows us how small we are, how forces beyond our wills are at stake everyday of our life, at every scale, from the body’s health to climate change and the universe. The more we look, the less we understand. So why do we do it? Well, we strive on the hope we might understand just an inch more. And hope is actually what Pandora ends up with. What better analogy is there for the struggles and beauty of scientific research than the tale of Pandora?</p>
					
					<p>So here we are, rather than discarding these good old tales as sexist, which frankly is very tempting, maybe we could instead tell them differently. Eve and Pandora, first analogy for scientists’/researchers' struggles and joys. And guess what, they are women! </p>
